# Sort-Files-By-Type
## File Sorting Process
This program takes a directory containing various types of files and sorts them into subdirectories based on their file extensions. For each file type, it creates a new folder named after the extension and moves the corresponding files into these folders.

### Example

**Before Sorting:**
```
primary_folder/
├── document.txt
├── script.py
├── image.jpg
├── data.csv
├── presentation.pptx
```

**After Sorting:**
```
primary_folder/
├── txt/
│   └── document.txt
├── py/
│   └── script.py
├── jpg/
│   └── image.jpg
├── csv/
│   └── data.csv
├── pptx/
    └── presentation.pptx
```
